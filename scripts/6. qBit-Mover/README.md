# qBittorrent Mover

This script pauses the last x days added torrents so the mover can move them from your cache to your array.

Don't forget to follow the original guide [How to run the unRaid mover for qBittorent seeding torrents](https://trash-guides.info/Downloaders/qBittorrent/Tips/How-to-run-the-unRaid-mover-for-qBittorrent/)

The `UserScripts` also runs JDupes after the move (You can get this from the nerdpack).
