# Description

qBit Manage config and docker-compose file.

## Info

i'm running a separate qbt for tv and movies (so i also need a separate qBit Manage).

- Make sure your paths and indexers you're using match what you're using.
- The docker-compose.yml is a generated compose.

### Extra info

I personally recommend to let qBit-Manage manage the Ratio/Seeding time, so make sure you disable the following in your Starr apps.
