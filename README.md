# Collection of (unRAID) userScripts and Configs

Here you will find a collection of scripts and configs that are designed to work on unRAID, however there shouldn't be any reason it wouldn't work on any Unix based system. <br>

However, on unRAID simply ensure you have `UserScripts` installed from the appstore > navigate to the `UserScripts` location within `Settings`> create a new script and then set your cron interval.
